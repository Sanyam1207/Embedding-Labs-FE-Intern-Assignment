This project is part of my internship assignment.
I created a Hero Section inspired by an existing website, implementing responsive design, animations, and a clean layout using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to:

Convert a design inspiration into a working Hero section.

Use modern frontend technologies.

Implement responsive layouts and reusable components

To Start the project --

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
